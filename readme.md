# Personal - Reboot

This is my new "portfolio" website built with Bootstrap and Jquery.
I think I over did the dark mode, code could've been simplerðŸ˜·

## Directory Structure

```bash
C:.
â”œâ”€â”€â”€css
â”œâ”€â”€â”€img
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€portfolio
â”œâ”€â”€â”€js
â””â”€â”€â”€vendor
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€bootstrap
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€css
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€fonts
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€js
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€font-awesome
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€css
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€fonts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€less
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€scss
    â””â”€â”€â”€jquery
```

Most of your work will go on in the `pages`, `css`, `js` and `img` directories.
